We are organizing a new online summit for Cloud data technology called Cloud Data Summit. It will be a 2-day 100% web-based conference on an incredible new web summit platform on October 16-17. Over 1000 tech and non-tech leaders, data scientists, and data engineers at large companies will be in attendance.

We are looking for a few more technology leaders who would like to speak

Primary Topics

How you designed elastic cloud systems at your organization
How you optimized your elastic cloud infrastructure
How you evaluated and selected technology platforms
Elastic cloud databases or data warehouses (SQL or NoSQL)
Data Integration/Preparation
Data Visualization
Microservices
AI and Machine Learning
IoT in the cloud (even if you have edge processing)
Streaming Data
Distributed applications
Blockchain

All presentations should be related to cloud data technology in some way, even if they aren't directly affected by it.

The audience has asked to see 
-Business cases 
-Success stories 
-Failures 
-Lessons learned 
-Light technical presentations 
-High level systems architecture slides

The attendees are a mix of managers, architects, data scientists, and data/cloud engineers so the Main Stage topics shouldn't be technically deep. Technical topics and deep dives will be held for roundtables.
